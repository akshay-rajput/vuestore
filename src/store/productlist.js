			name: 'Ghost Size',
			description: "New school meets old school, clinically dosed, packed to the nines, transparent AF, muscle builder conceived to make gains faster than photoshop.",
			details: "New school (Creatine HCl) meets old school (Creatine Monohydrate) Creatine combination added to maximize efficacy, absorption and solubility. GHOST® Size contains the first ever \"Full Yield Creatine\" delivering 5G of actual yielded Creatine per scoop. You're right, most brands add 5G of Creatine, but because Creatine isn't 100% pure you're left with much less than 5G of actual delivered Creatine. At GHOST® we cherish every gram (and the gains that come along with them), so we've beefed up our Creatine (3.21G HCl & 2.84G Monohydrate) to ensure you're getting the FULL, DELIVERED 5G dose in every scoop.",

			name: 'Ghost Legend',
			description: "We aren’t the type to make crazy claims or talk nuanced product specifications (there’s this thing called the internet for those that want to research). All you need to know is that GHOST LEGEND® packs more than 2x of the stuff you care about most into every scoop than most “leading” pre-workouts.",
			details: "Citrulline is one of the best pump ingredients on the market. Most brands elect to stick Citrulline in a proprietary blend, under dose the compound or use ‘Citrulline Malate,’ which today is no more than a blend of L-Citrulline and Malic Acid, often in an undisclosed ratio. In fact, the 4 grams of L-Citrulline per scoop in GHOST Legend® is equivalent to the L-Citrulline content of 8 grams of Citrulline Malate! Pure L-Citrulline may be more expensive, but anecdotally provides better pumps without the potential for stomach discomfort caused by the additional acid.",

Reds are just as important to get in as greens, and even though most brands skimp on them because they're expensive, GHOST pulled out all the stops with 9 premium super foods including Jabuticaba (fun to say and super good for you!), Camu Camu (the fruit so nice they named it twice) and Organic Goji Berry.",
